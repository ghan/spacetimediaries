      <h2>Multi-dimensional storytelling</h2>
      <p>Is it possible to manipulate gravitational waves to create shortcuts in spacetime? What if we could engineer machines to do this for us? What if only the richest few could afford it? Or, what if microscopic organisms evolve the ability first?</p>
      <p>Time travel is a topic as old as science fiction, so let’s not presume there’s any concept not already explored in it. Spacetime Diaries seeks to take this well-worn motif and use it as a jumping-off point to tell a wide variety of stories, hopefully in a slightly different and new way.</p>
      <p>Season 1 is a 75 minute, eight episode musical drama. There are songs, dialogue, sound effects, foley, sound design, and narration — all working together to create an immersive storytelling experience. </p>
      <p>Future iterations are allowed to be shorter and have different elements. Season 2 is being developed now, and may sound completely different. Before that completes, video content may be released to support the Season 1 universe. Spacetime Diaries might find a storytelling home on TikTok, or Instagram, or Youtube. The ultimate goal is to make fertile creative soil for as many and as diverse a group of artists as possible.</p>
      <p>If you’d like to create something with the Spacetime Diaries team, please don’t hesitate to reach out. If you have an idea for us to produce, do share. And if you simply enjoy what we’re doing, we’d love to hear that too. </p>
      <p>Many thanks for your support,</p>
